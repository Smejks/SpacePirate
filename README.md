Hobby Project I made by myself in Game Maker Studio in my freetime while studying.
I wanted to make everything myself, sprites, music, sound effects etc.
My goal was to create a simple game with fun controls, clear goals and immersive sound design.

The things I feel like I succeeded with is the sound design, transitions and gameplay fine tuning such as controls, homing missile behaviour and powerup ramp up.
Things I identify that could have been improved is communicating the win state to the player, removing unfun elements like accidentally killing the transport ship etc.
